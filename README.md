## settings
A copy of my bash/vim/git settings for sharing or for accessing on different computers. 

A lot of these files I borrowed from other people, and they are a mix of settings from different computers I use (the remote Unix
clusters at my school, for instance, have a different settings file than my personal laptop) so they probably need some parsing
before anyone can use them.
